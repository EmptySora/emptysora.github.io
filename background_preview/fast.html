                Loose approximation of my stream background.<br/>
                Each image cyles every <code>5</code> minutes, and transitions take <code>10</code> seconds.<br/>
                <br/>
                Due to the fact that the <code>background-image</code> CSS property is not animatable, perfectly approximating the animation
                will fail for the following reasons:<br />
                1. The transition overrides the animation itself (forcing us to put the old images in a container element so the animation
                can be applied to <b>that</b> and not override the scrolling effect.)<br />
                2. Since this animation is achieved by having two images on top of each other, the latter image with an <code>opacity</code>
                of <code>0.5</code>, it means that getting a perfectly transitioning element is impossible. Since there are, in effect, four
                images on the page (two for the bottom layer, two for the top layer; two for the old image, two for the new image), and the
                fact that the images are transitioned with the <code>opacity</code> CSS property, it means that the top layer's true opacity
                is the product of the opacities of the images making it up. IE: if you had a black background, and covered it twice with half
                opacity white rectangles spanning the entire thing, <i>the resulting image would be <code>50%</code>black, and <code>75%</code>
                white.</i> Thus, for animating the transition, when both images in the top layer are visible at at most <code>50%</code>
                opacity, it means that the top layer's true opacity is <code>75%</code> (instead of the expected <code>50%</code>).<br/>
                <br/>
                The only way to fix this would be to physically blend the two images together using the opacity as a base, and setting
                <i>that</i> image with an opacity of <code>50%</code>. For performance reasons, I'm not even going to attempt to do that.
                However, through the Canvas API, it's likely possible to individually merge each pixel in both images, draw that to a canvas
                that then has <code>50%</code> opacity.<br/>
                <br/>
                The whole point with using overlaid images and CSS is so that we <b>don't</b> have to resort to manually blending the images
                (which will near-assuredly perform much worse than native CSS). IE: life sucks and it isn't fair.<br/>
